# Tiny URL

A short URL is a condensed version of a long URL, created using algorithms or services to make URLs shorter and more manageable. By transforming lengthy web addresses into compact forms, short URLs are easier to share, remember, and fit into contexts with character limits, such as social media posts or SMS.

## Importance of Short URLs
